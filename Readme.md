## Hi!

I am Mohamed "Donn" Gaber, a graduate student affiliated with the
[American University in Cairo's Open Hardware Lab](https://github.com/AUCOHL).
I am currently also a part-time CAD Tool Engineering Contractor with
[Silimate, Inc](https://github.com/silimate) and a member of the
[FOSSi Foundation](https://fossi-foundation.org).

I am the primary maintainer of
[LibreLane](https://github.com/librelane/librelane), which is the successor to
the [OpenLane 2](https://github.com/efabless/openlane2) project I started and
maintained at Efabless Corporation.

I studied Computer Engineering at the
[American University in Cairo](https://aucegypt.edu/).

## Highlights

- [LibreLane](https://github.com/librelane/librelane) — Infrastructure for
  high-quality, modular and repeatable ASIC flows, that implements a flow that
  is backwards-compatible with OpenLane. Started at Efabless as
  [OpenLane 2.0](https://github.com/efabless/openlane2).
- [OpenLane](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenLane) — The premier
  open-source RTL-to-GDSII flow by Efabless Corporation, used for countless
  designs on the Google OpenMPW and Efabless chipIgnite shuttles, based on
  Yosys, OpenROAD, Magic, KLayout and other tools.
- [Fault](https://github.com/AUCOHL/Fault) — Somehow the only open-source
  design-for-test solution, including ATPG, Scan Chain Stitching, and TAP
  insertion and verification.

### Side Projects

These get patches in my dwindling spare time and are pretty inactive, but I'm
still mostly proud of them.

- [Nudelta](https://github.com/donn/nudelta) — A reverse-engineered open-source
  alternative to the console for the NuPhy Air75 and Halo75 v1 keyboards
- [Oak](https://github.com/donn/Oak.js) — A browser-based assembler/simulator
  for MIPS and RISC-V
- [Phi](https://github.com/donn/Phi) — A more focused take on Verilog that
  was my undergrad thesis project/parser learning playground
